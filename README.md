# Typescript Serverless API Template

This starter project provides an example setup for a serverless API implemented using TypeScript and Terraform. It provides the following features:

- AWS HTTP Gateway to route HTTP requests to AWS Lambda functions
- Handlers for HTTP routes in TypeScript
- Every handler deployed in a separate Lambda for minimal cold-start times
- Configuration for the API Gateway automatically generated by mapping `.ts` files in a `src/routes` folder to HTTP routes
- All infrastructure defined in Terraform for easy extensibility and configuration

This project can be cloned in modified to be used for your API. For this, please adapt the configuration in [`goldstack.json`](https://github.com/mxro/typescript-serverless-api/blob/master/packages/lambda-api/goldstack.json) and specifically here the `"api-domain"` and `"hostedZoneDomain"`. Please also delete the line containing `"tfStateKey"`.

You can also use the [Serverless API](https://goldstack.party/templates/lambda-api) template on [Goldstack](https://goldstack.party). This project was created using this template and the Goldstack UI makes it easy to configure the template for your needs.
